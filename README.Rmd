# STAT 545A Homework 09 Repo owned by Ziqiang Tang

## Overview

This assignment is to modify the make activity pipeline we made in class. You can go to **[report.html](https://raw.githack.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-ziqiangt/master/report.html)**. The whole work is build by **[Makefile](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-ziqiangt/tree/master/bcl/Makefile)**.

**My repository is structured as follows:**

## Makefile structure

**This struture is generated with the help of [lindenbe's Python scripts](https://github.com/vak/makefile2dot). You may need to use these two codes to install Graphviz:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install graphviz
```

The makefile structure is shown as below:**
